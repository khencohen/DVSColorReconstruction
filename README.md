Illumination-Based Color Reconstruction for the Dynamic Vision Sensor

Code base for Light Obsevation aNd Glare Dvs Image Coloring.
Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06695

This work demonstrates a novel, state of the art method to reconstruct colored images via the Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). The DVS is an image sensor that indicates only a binary change in brightness, with no information about the captured wavelength (color), or intensity level. We present a novel method to reconstruct a full spatial resolution colored image with the DVS and an active colored light source. We analyze the DVS response and present two reconstruction algorithms: Linear based and Convolutional Neural Network Based. In addition, we demonstrate our algorithm robustness to changes in environmental conditions such as illumination and distance. Finally, comparing with previous works, we show how we reach the state of the art results.
